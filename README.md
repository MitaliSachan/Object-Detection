# Object-Detection
This model detects object from a given image using YOLOv3.
Object detection is a phenomenon in computer vision that involves the detection of various objects in digital images or videos.

YOLO is an abbreviation for the term ‘You Only Look Once’. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time). Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images.YOLO algorithm has gained popularity because of its superior performance over the aforementioned object detection techniques.
